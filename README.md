# arc_gui (ROBOT SIDE)

App for the robot side of the ARC project. It is used to launch the ROS packages without using the ROS command, with an intuitive UI. The goal is to be used by anyone, even without IT knowledge.

## TODO List ##

* Disable launch parameter selection pages while running
* Disable launch button if the launch parameters not selected
* Button to import the launch parameters selection
* Display status next to the Launch button
* Install wizard
* Icon
* Video stream display while launched
* Manage C++ packages (it should read both, Python and C++, but display clearly the difference in the interface, especially if the same name)
* Add requirement to config files (e.g. a specific robot that works only with ROS as communication method)
